# Ahmed Hammad Portfolio:

## Why I created this portfolio?
I created this portfolio as I wanted to have one place to showcase my work and also create a dynamic portfolio that can be updated as I write new code. I wanted to have a portfolio that is simple, easy to maintain.

## What did I use to code the portfolio?
I'm using HTML5 and CSS3 technologies. HTML is simple markup language to display web pages while css is a style sheet language used to create style and design.
